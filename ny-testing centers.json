Residents can make advance appointments by calling 888-364-3065. Hours of operation are seven days a week, 7 am to 7 pm.\n\nAnyone from across Long Island, not just in Suffolk, who has contacted the New York State Department of Health (DOH) at 888-364-3065 and is part of the highest-risk population as determined by DOH will be tested. Anyone who believes they’re at risk should call the DOH Hotline, 888-364-3065, and talk to experts to determine if and how they should be tested. Walk-ins will not be seen.",
